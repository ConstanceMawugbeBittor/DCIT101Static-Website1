 <paragraph style="background-color :rgb (213, 232, 241) "><font size="5"><P1>The university is primarily based in the Legon suburb of Accra, Ghana’s capital, with a teaching hospital and secondary campus in Accra itself.
                Its medical school is located in Korle Bu, southern Ghana with a graduate school of nuclear and allied sciences based at the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (the University of Ghana is one of only a few universities in Africa that offers programmes in nuclear physics and nuclear engineering).
             </P1>
          <P2>The University of Ghana consistently ranks in the top 10 universities of Africa. Its variety of colleges can accommodate students from just about any UC major. 
     On campus, you may find research projects and collaborations tackling some of the most pressing global problems of our time: malaria, climate change, food production, development, and poverty.
     Among its research centers, you can find medical research, tropical pharmacology, population studies, environmental studies, and economics.
    Located just 10 miles from Ghana’s capital Accra, the university is UCEAP’s most long-standing partnership in Africa. 
    The campus features tree-lined gardens and distinctive buildings like the open-air theater built into the slope of Legon Hill.
